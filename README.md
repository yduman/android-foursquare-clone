# Intro
To learn Android development, I started implementing a clone of the app Foursquare. This repository uses common technologies and libraries to get used to Android development. This project does not fulfill Material Design guidelines, since this was a uni project and I had limited time. 

# Development Requirements
* **WARNING: This repo will not work out-of-the-box after perfoming the steps below, since some secrets like mailing, Foursquare API secrets are modified!**
* You will need to install
    * **Node** (Version 7.10)
    * latest version of **Android Studio** 
* For the DB, install **MongoDB** and **Robomongo**
* After cloning run `npm install` in the `backend/` folder to install dependencies
* run `nodemon server/server.js` to run backend

# Features
* user management
* user profile
* find venues (list, map)
* venue actions (search, rate, comment)
* all chat

# Technologies
* Java 8
* NodeJS backend
* MongoDB database
* own REST-API
* Foursquare-API to fetch venues
* some common libraries like Express, ButterKnife etc.
